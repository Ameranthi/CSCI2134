Refactorings:
=============

0. EXAMPLE:  
   File: SpressoBot.java, ChickenBot.jaba, AngryBot.java, TimBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): getNextMove()
   Issue Idetified: Common code to check if move will result in 
                    energy use and decrement energyLevel if that 
                    is the case
   Description of fix:  Push the common code into TimBot.java, creating a
                        protected method to be used instead.
   Implemented: Yes (Completely, all tests pass)

1. File: SpressoBot.java, ChickenBot.jaba, AngryBot.java, TimBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): getNextMove(), 71 
   Issue Idetified: Common code to find the minimum move
   Description of fix: Push the common code into TimBot.java, creating a
                        protected method to be used instead.
   Implemented:Yes (Completely, all tests pass)

2. File: SpressoBot.java and ChickenBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): getNextMove(), 48 & 49
   Issue Idetified: code in chicken and spressoBot have int values without 				an const/final int variable for them 
   Description of fix: made them both have variable attached to the int 				values that were being used in the loop 				possibilities 
   Implemented: no

3. File: SpressoBot.java and ChickenBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): getNextMove() ,  52
   Issue Idetified: common code to loop through the scores and find all 			possibilities
   Description of fix: push the common code into TimBot and create a protected void loopForPossibilities()method to be used instead
   Implemented: no

4. File: BullyBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): fireCanon(), 50-53
   Issue Idetified: code block that assesses if the count is greater than the energy available and required energy to start up. 
   Description of fix: push code block to TimBot and create final variables for the if statements (energyLevel - 2) 2 should have a final variable attached to it. 
    
   Implemented:no

5. File:
